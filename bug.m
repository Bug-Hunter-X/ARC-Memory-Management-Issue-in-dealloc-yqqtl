In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and manual memory management.  Consider a scenario where you create a custom class with properties that retain objects. If you don't properly manage the lifecycle of these objects, particularly in dealloc, you could encounter unexpected crashes or memory leaks.

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    // Missing release or setting to nil of myString
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

Without explicitly setting `myString` to `nil` in `dealloc` (or using `weak` properties), a strong reference cycle could occur if `myString` also holds a strong reference to your `MyClass` instance, leading to a memory leak. Even with ARC, you still have responsibilities around object lifecycle management.
